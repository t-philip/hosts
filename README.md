## Host file for the Pi-Hole Gravity list to block streaming music & video domains
### This file can also be used in any OS that supports host file to block domains.
In case you want to add all possible sub-domains and directories for a specific domain name, then use **RegEx**. This can be added in the **Blacklist** =>**RegEx** in Pi-Hole's web interface or command line.  
-*The list will be updated as and when I discover more domains*
